# For creating the database:
####  1. Make sure you have postgres already installed, along with psql.
####  2. If you're on windows, you create the database with the script that I provided copying and pasting it to psql, making sure to read the instructions in side of it first.
##### Notes: The connection script is already here, just change it with your credentials.
